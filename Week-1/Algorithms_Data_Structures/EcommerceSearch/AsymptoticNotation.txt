◉ What are Asymptotic Notations?
 - Asymptotic notations are mathematical tools used to analyze and describe the performance of
algorithms as their input size increases.They help us understand how efficient an algorithm is 
without getting bogged down in specific hardware details or implementation specifics.

There are three primary types of asymptotic notations that work together to give us a complete picture of an algorithm's performance:

1. Big O (Upper Bound): Represents the worst-case scenario or upper bound of an algorithm's performance.
2. Big Ω (Lower Bound): Represents the best-case scenario or lower bound of an algorithm's performance.
3. Big Θ (Exact Bound): Represents the exact complexity when the upper and lower bounds are equal.

◉ Big O Notation Explanation:
  •Definition: Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to used to analyze the performance (time/space complexity) of algorithms
    based on input size 'n'. It gives a high-level understanding of the algorithm's efficiency.

  •Importance: It helps to analyze algorithms, compare their performance, and predict scalability.

  Search Operation Scenarios:
    • Best Case: The target element is found at the very first comparison.
    • Average Case: The target element is found somewhere in the middle of the search process.
    • Worst Case: The target element is not found, leading to the maximum number of comparisons.
