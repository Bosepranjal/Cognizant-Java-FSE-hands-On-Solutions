◉ Time Complexity Comparison:

   • Linear Search:
        1.Best Case: O(1) (if the element is found at the first position)
        2.Average Case: O(n) (average time for n elements)
        3.Worst Case: O(n) (if the element is not found)

   • Binary Search:
        1.Best Case: O(1) (if the middle element is the target)
        2.Average Case: O(log n) (divides the array in half with each iteration)
        3.Worst Case: O(log n) (same as average case)

◉ Suitability for E-commerce Platform ?
  
  Linear Search:
                Pros: 1. Simple to implement.
                      2. No need for sorted data.
                Cons:
                      1. Slower for large datasets.
  Binary Search:
                Pros: 1. Much faster for large datasets due to logarithmic time complexity.
                      2. Efficient in a retrieval-focused context, particularly when frequently searching through 
                          the same dataset.
                Cons:
                      1. Requires the data to be sorted, which adds an overhead if data is frequently updated.

● Conclusion : 
Recommendation --> (Binary Search) is generally the better choice for an e-commerce search function for the following reasons:
1. It provides significantly faster search times for large datasets, which is critical in an e-commerce setting where users expect quick search results.
2. With proper handling, such as maintaining sorted data as products are added, the benefits of binary search outweigh the initial costs associated with sorting.
